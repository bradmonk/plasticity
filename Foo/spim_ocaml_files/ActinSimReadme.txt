Each G-actin monomer has 3 binding sites: left, right, and mid. An individual unit of actin can exist in 1 of 7 states:

Af 	: free
Al 	: bound on left
Ar 	: bound on right
Ab 	: bound on mid
Alm	: bound on left & mid
Arm	: bound on right & mid
Abm	: bound on both (l+r) & mid


This simulation is run with 1200 actin monomers (Af) and 30 Arp2/3 complexes (Rf)
